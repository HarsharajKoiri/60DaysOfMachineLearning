# Machine Learning Types

## üè∑Ô∏è Labels in Machine Learning

###  Simple Explanation
- Labels are the "correct answers" given to a model during training - like answers in a workbook.

###  Technical Definition
- In supervised learning, labels (target variables) are known outputs associated with input data.

### üí° Key Notes
- Used in **supervised learning** (e.g., "cat"/"dog" tags for images)
- **Not used** in unsupervised or reinforcement learning

## ‚≠ê Supervised Learning

![Supervised-learning](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/28de6057-20e2-4f02-8405-cee314a7790d)


###  Simple Explanation
- Learning with a teacher who provides answers - like solving math problems with an answer key.

###  Technical Definition
- Trains models on labeled datasets to predict outcomes for unseen data.

### üìä Types & Algorithms

#### 1. Classification (Predicting categories)
```python
Algorithms: Decision Trees, SVM, Neural Networks
Example: Email spam detection (spam vs not spam)
```
#### 2. Regression (Predicting numbers)
```python
Algorithms: Linear Regression, Random Forest
Example: Predicting house prices
```
###  Workflow

1. Feed model input features (e.g., image pixels)
2. Compare predictions to true labels
3. Adjust model to reduce errors

###  Real-Life Example
- Medical diagnosis: Predicting diseases from symptoms

## ‚≠ê Unsupervised Learning

![Unsupervised-learning](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/95267238-b5ac-47cd-b07f-ad73959ff1fd)

###  Simple Explanation
- Finding hidden patterns without instructions - like sorting Legos blindfolded.

###  Technical Definition
- Analyzes unlabeled data to discover intrinsic structures.

### üìä Types & Algorithms

#### 1. Clustering (Grouping data)
```python
Algorithms: K-Means, DBSCAN
Example: Customer segmentation
```
#### 2. Dimensionality Reduction
```python
Algorithms: PCA, t-SNE
Example: Compressing 1000 features to 2D
```

###  Workflow
1. Input raw data (e.g., purchase history)
2. Algorithm identifies patterns

###  Features
- No labels needed
- Features must capture data diversity

###  Real-Life Example
- Netflix recommendations based on viewing habits

## ‚≠ê Reinforcement Learning

![1-(2)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6e881180-91a2-4209-a44f-af048d1776e1)

###  Simple Explanation
- Learning by trial and error - like training a dog with treats.

###  Technical Definition
- Agent learns optimal actions by maximizing rewards.

### üìä Types & Algorithms
#### 1. Model-Free (Learns by doing)
```python
Algorithms: Q-Learning, DQN
Example: Game AI
```

#### 2. Model-Based (Uses simulations)
```python
Algorithms: AlphaGo
Example: Self-driving car practice
```

###  Workflow
1. Agent takes action (e.g., moves forward)
2. Environment gives reward/penalty
3. Agent updates strategy

###  Features
- States: Environment snapshots
- Actions: Possible moves

###  Real-Life Example
- Robots learning to walk

## üèÜ Comparison Table

| Learning Type       | Needs Labels? | Goal                     | Best For                  |
|---------------------|---------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Supervised**      | ‚úÖ Yes        | Predict outcomes         | Classification, Regression|
| **Unsupervised**    | ‚ùå No         | Find hidden patterns     | Clustering, Dimensionality|
| **Reinforcement**   | ‚ùå No         | Learn optimal actions    | Decision-making systems   |

## üìö How to Remember

**Supervised** = Teacher-student

**Unsupervised** = Sorting blindfolded

**Reinforcement** = Training a pet
