# 1. What is Machine Learning?
  - Machine Learning (ML) = A method where computers learn from data instead of being explicitly programmed.

## Goal: 
  - Predict outcomes or find patterns.

- ML is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI).

## Example: 
  - Recommending videos on YouTube, spam detection in Gmail.

# 2. Types of Machine Learning			

  - ### Supervised Learning
      - Train with input and output (labeled data)
      - *Eg:* Email spam detection (spam/ham)
      
  - ### Unsupervised Learning
      - Train with only input, no output labels
      - *Eg:* Customer segmentation, Grouping similar news

  - ### Reinforcement Learning
      - Learn by reward and punishment
      - *Eg:* Teaching a robot to walk

# 3. Key Terminologies

  **Term**                   **Meaning**
  *Model*                      The algorithm that learns from data
  *Training*                   Teaching the model with available data
  *Testing*                    Checking model performance on new data
  *Features*                   Input variables (example: size of house)
  *Labels*                     Output variable (example: price of house)
  *Dataset*                    Collection of data points (rows + columns)
  *Algorithm*                  The logic that finds patterns (example: Decision Tree, Linear Regression)

# 4. Very Important ML Cycle
   
    Collect Data   ➔
    Prepare Data   ➔
    Choose Model   ➔
    Train Model    ➔
    Evaluate Model ➔
    Predict New Data

# 5. Real-Life Examples of ML

###  YouTube recommends videos (based on your history).
###  Netflix suggests shows.
###  Credit card fraud detection.
###  Self-driving cars.
###  Medical diagnosis from X-rays.
