# 1. What is Machine Learning?
  - Machine Learning (ML) = A method where computers learn from data instead of being explicitly programmed.

## Goal: 
  - Predict outcomes or find patterns.

- ML is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI).
  
---
## Example: 
  - Recommending videos on YouTube, spam detection in Gmail.

# 2. Types of Machine Learning			

  - ### Supervised Learning
      - Train with input and output (labeled data)
      - *Eg:* Email spam detection (spam/ham)
      
  - ### Unsupervised Learning
      - Train with only input, no output labels
      - *Eg:* Customer segmentation, Grouping similar news

  - ### Reinforcement Learning
      - Learn by reward and punishment
      - *Eg:* Teaching a robot to walk

# 3. Key Terminologies

<pre>
  Term                         Meaning<br>
  Model                      The algorithm that learns from data<br>
  Training                   Teaching the model with available data<br>
  Testing                    Checking model performance on new data<br>
  Features                   Input variables (example: size of house)<br>
  Labels                     Output variable (example: price of house)<br>
  Dataset                    Collection of data points (rows + columns)<br>
  Algorithm                  The logic that finds patterns (example: Decision Tree, Linear Regression)

    Collect Data   ➔
    Prepare Data   ➔
    Choose Model   ➔
    Train Model    ➔
    Evaluate Model ➔
    Predict New Data

  - Netflix suggests shows.<br>
  - Credit card fraud detection.<br>
  - Self-driving cars.<br>
  - Medical diagnosis from X-rays.<br>

#  Code Summary

### ✅ Python Basics
- Created two variables `x` and `y`, added them and printed the **sum**.
- Used a **`for` loop** to print index values from 0 to 4.

---

### ✅ NumPy Basics
- Imported **NumPy** library.
- Created a **NumPy array** `arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
- Performed **element-wise multiplication**: multiplied each element by 2.

---

### ✅ Pandas Basics
- Imported **Pandas** library.
- Loaded a **CSV dataset** (Iris dataset) directly from a URL.
- Displayed the **first 5 rows** of the dataset using `df.head()`.
- Displayed the **statistical description** of the dataset using `df.describe()`.

---

### ✅ Matplotlib Basics
- Imported **Matplotlib**.
- Created a **simple line plot** with points (1,2), (2,4), (3,6), (4,8), (5,10).
- Added **title**, **X-axis label**, and **Y-axis label**.
- Displayed the graph using `plt.show()`.

#  What we learned today:
- Variables and loops in Python.
- Basics of **NumPy** (arrays and operations).
- Basics of **Pandas** (loading data, viewing data, describing data).
- Basics of **Matplotlib** (plotting a simple graph).
